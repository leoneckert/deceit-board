# deceit-board


Deceit Board is a physical device intercepting the signal between keyboard and computer. By adding delays and spoof signals, it anonymises your unique typing pattern, rendering it useless for data collectors.

## How it works

The deceit board (in its first iteration) uses a Teensy board running Arduino code and a ps/2 keyboard input. It receives and processes signals from an external keyboard before it passes them on to the computer.
